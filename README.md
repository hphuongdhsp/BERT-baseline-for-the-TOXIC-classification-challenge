# BERT-baseline-for-the-TOXIC-classification-challenge
This repository is the BERT benchmark for the classification.

**BERT** was released together with the paper [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) by Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee and Kristina Toutanova.

Here we use data of the Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification challenge whose mission is to detect toxicity across a diverse range of conversations(https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification).
